# Preface {-}

`r text_top_count`

This is a work-in-progress Matlab package consisting of functions that solve the dynamic life cycle model in Nygaard, Sorensen and Wang (2020) [@SNW2020]. The code companion presents solutions to the dynamic life-cycle problem, and methods for evaluating the marginal gains from allocating additional welfare checks. Tested with [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) 2019a [@matlab].

All functions are parts of a matlab toolbox that can be installed:

> Download and install the Matlab toolbox: [PrjOptiSNW.mltbx](https://github.com/FanWangEcon/PrjOptiSNW/blob/master/PrjOptiSNW.mltbx)

This bookdown file is a collection of mlx based vignettes for functions that are available from [PrjOptiSNW](https://github.com/FanWangEcon/PrjOptiSNW). Each Vignette file contains various examples for invoking each function. The goal of this repository is to make it easier to find/re-use codes produced for various projects.
