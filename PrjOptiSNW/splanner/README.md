Solve for planner values.

The functions here are memory intensive: solving at first for all check VU and
VW,  storing results in a large 7D dimensional array, then computing v_tilde for
all.

2019 V_tilde finds the savings, shock, and education group that fall into each
income bin, and compute the expected value E(V_W(a',shock'), V_U(a',shock') in
2020 given
