In constrast to splanner, splanneralt is faster and less memory intensive. In
splanner we have VU, VW, and Vplanner (V_tilde). Here, we have VU, VW,
E_{unemploy}(VUVW}, Vtilde_jaeemk_check, and also Vtilde_jymk_check.

Vtilde_jaeemk is the V_tilde at all elements of the state space for 2020.
Vtilde_jymk are the V_tilde given the j,y,m,k statespace.

E_{unemploy}(VUVW}, Vtilde_jaeemk, and Vtilde_jymk are important outcomes that
because they are outputed individually here, make it possible to analyze and
review them here.

splanneralt relies on some functions from splanner
