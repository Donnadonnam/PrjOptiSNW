    Solves for V and C for individuals at lower (2 percent) and higher (4 percent) savings interest rate.
    An increase change in the savings rate generates both an income effect (higher resources) and also changes relative price of consumption today vs tomorrow; households value/welfare increase and might overall consume more or less depending on their state-space.

  description: |
    This function solves for the V(states) for individuals at lower and higher discount factor . We allow for  heterogeneity in the model to consider both patient and impatient households. The key difference is that patient households are more willing to save and will consume less.
