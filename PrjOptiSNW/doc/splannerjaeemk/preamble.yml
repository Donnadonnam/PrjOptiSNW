  description: |
    Expected value and expected consumption from 2020 for a household given at a particular age (18-100), with a particular savings level, at a particular combination of household head and spouse income shocks, with 0 to 4 children, high or low Education status, and married or not married.
    This uses the unemployment probability and generates the average value given the probability of the unemployment state that is dependent on the state-space.

  description: |
    Compute the difference in Value and Consumption under differing levels of Bush Stimulus. We assume that the stimulus is provided ex-ante of the 2009 great recession shocks, which are expected by households (not MIT shock as under COVID).
    This is simialr to SNW_EVUVW20_JAEEMK, but for the 2008 Bush stimulus. SNW_V08P08_JAEEMK already solved for optimal policy and value functions in 2008, given expected unemployment shock in 2009. In this function, given some stimulus amount, we use SNW_A4CHK_WRK_BISEC_VEC to compute the updated optimal V and C in 2008 given the stimulus amount, based on the alues for V and C without stimulus computed by SNW_V08P08_JAEEMK.
