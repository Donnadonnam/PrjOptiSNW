%% Household Problem and Distributions

% Nygaard, Sorensen and Wang (2020)>, we study the optimal allocation of COVID-19 
% stimulus checks. Congress spent $250 billion sending checks to individuals in

% 
% This Matlab based programming guide, package, and associated vignettes, provide 
% examples and instructions on how the dynamic programming problem in Nygaard, 
% Sorensen and Wang (2020) is solved. The R optimal allocation package <https://fanwangecon.github.io/PrjOptiAlloc/

%% Flat Script and Code Package

% code program is programmed up separately with its own testing vignette and default 
% parameter structure. Various solution algorithms are provided at each step, 
% with the final checks problem relying on efficient and precise solution methods. 
%% Dynamic Programming Solution Structure COVIDless World
% First we solve for the optimal consumption/savings problem in the COVID-less 
% world:
%% 
% * *83*: 2020 age groups, age 18 to 100 age groups
% * *65*: grid of savings state-space grid, and exact continuous optimal savings 
% choices using the <https://fanwangecon.github.io/MEconTools/MEconTools/doc/vfi/htmlpdfm/fx_vfi_az_bisec_vec.html 
% *FF_VFI_AZ_BISEC_VEC*> function from <https://fanwangecon.github.io/MEconTools/ 
% *MEconTools*>.
% * *6650 shocks*: 1330 productivity shocks for household head and sposue and 
% 5 kids transition count shocks
% * *2* permanent education states
% * *2* permanent marital states
%% 
% The state-space has: 2*2*6650*65*83= 143,507,000 elements. The choice-space 
% is is continuous. Two important things two note: 
%% 
% # The large number of shocks are needed to obtain accurate group-specific 
% marginal propensity effects for small income bins that define the choice-set 
% of the allocation problem.
% # While a choice-grid-based solution algorithm might sufficiently approximate 
% the value function, but its policy function zig-zags. For the stimulus checks 
% problem, where stimulus checks come in small increments, the zig-zags lead to 
% fluctuating (negative and positive) marginal propensities to consume as resource 
% availability increases for very small amounts of check increments. To deal with 
% this challenge, we rely on the <https://fanwangecon.github.io/MEconTools/MEconTools/doc/vfi/htmlpdfm/fx_vfi_az_bisec_vec.html 
% *FF_VFI_AZ_BISEC_VEC*> function from <https://fanwangecon.github.io/MEconTools/ 
% *MEconTools*> to provides efficient exact savings choices. 
%% 
% Solving this dynamic life-cycle programming problem requires approximately 
% 10 to 20 minutes on a home-pc depending on computer speed. There is no processor 
% requirements. Memory requirement is approximately 20GB. There are two core associated 
% functions vignettes that solves the dynamic programming problem to obtain value/policy 
% and distributions induceds by exogenous processes and the policy function:

%% Dynamic Programming Solution Structure during COVID Year
% During the COVID year, we use the value function from the COVID-less world 
% as the continuation value, and solve for consumption-savings policy/value functions 
% during the COVID year. We solve once for households facing realized COVID surprise 
% unemployment shocks, one more time for households who do not experience COVID 
% unemployment shocks. 
% 
% We solve for the marginal consumption differences and value given 244 increments 
% of checks ($100) each check. This is done again by using the <https://fanwangecon.github.io/MEconTools/MEconTools/doc/vfi/htmlpdfm/fx_vfi_az_bisec_vec.html 
% *FF_VFI_AZ_BISEC_VEC*> function from <https://fanwangecon.github.io/MEconTools/ 
% *MEconTools*>. While checks could be viewed as an additional state variable, 
% we evaluate the marginal effects of check by solving for the equivalent household-specpfic 
% variation in savings state that has the same effect as a stimulus check transfer. 
% The process takes into account the nonlinear tax-schedule that households face 
% as well as return on savings. 
% 
% Overall:
%% 
% * 286 million: Solve 143 million state-space points twice under COVID unemployment 
% and COVID employment world
% * 70 billion: Solve at the 143 million state-space elements 244 + 1 times 
% for all possible check levels (244 checks + no check value/consumption) to arrive 
% at 70 billion marginal propensity to consume for households with heterogeneities 
% in education level, marital status, children below 18 count (0 to 4), age, savings 
% levels, household head and spouse shocks.
