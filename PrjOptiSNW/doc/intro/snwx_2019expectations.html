%% Values of Checks Conditional on 2019 Information
% Eligibility for the stimulus checks was tied to each household’s income and 
% family size in the year prior to COVID-19. Consistent with this, we focus on 
% the optimal allocation of stimulus checks given household characteristics in 
% 2019.
%% Expected Outcomes given 2019 Information
% In the actual welfare checks allocation policy setting, 2020 realized individual 
% level COVID shocks and other productivity shocks were not used by the IRS to 
% determine allocation eligibility. Instead, the IRS used information available 
% from 2019. Given the persistence of productivity shocks, as well as the correlation 
% between surprised COVID shock and household income and age from 2019, 2019 information 
% are good predicators of household status in 2020. 
% 
% We compute the expected outcomes from 2019 perspective conditional on household 
% attributes that are observed to the IRS in 2020 given information they gathered 
% in 2019.  The planner does not observe the full state-space so we intergrate 
% from 2019 perspective given 2019 to 2020 COVID transition probabilities (conditional 
% on state-space) and kids and shock transitions.
%% 
% * 82 age groups: Age 18 to 99
% * 5 kids groups: Children 0 to 4
% * 2 marital groups: Marital Status 0 or 1
% * 509 Income Groups: 476 bins below max actual phaseout: solved at $500 intervals 
% between $0 and $238,000, and 33 bins after max actual phaseout: solved at $5000 
% interval after $238,000, where the 33rd final bin is between $401,130 and Maximum.
%% 
% Together, these are: 5*2*83*509 = 422,470 groups/bins in 2019. We have (244+1) 
% marginal average consumption gain, and value gain for each of the groups, so 
% from 2019 planner perspective, we have 103.5 million expected MPCs (and expected 
% value changes): 422470*(244+1)=103,505,150.
% 
% Each income group is composed of individuals of with different 2019 productivity 
% shocks and savings levels. Given the transition probabilities, policy functions, 
% and covid-less distributions across household types, we can compute the joint 
% distribution of education type, shocks, and savings levels condition on income 
% bins, martial status, kids count and age. This joint distribution is only well 
% approximated when sufficient number of shocks were used when solving for value/policy 
% in the covid-less world and covid-year world.

% snwx_evuvw19_jaeemk> provides the expected outcomes conditional on 2019 age, 
% savings levels, shocks, educational status, marital status and kids under 18 
% count, given the transition probabilities that incorporate the surprise COVID 
% shock. Households do not optimize in 2019 given COVID shock probabilities, the 
% shock is a surprise. But expected value in 2019 given 2019 state-space for consumption 
% and value depends on COVID shock and the non-covid households dynamic consumption/savings 
% choices in 2019.

% of savings, shock and educational status.

% snwx_evuvw19_jmky_allchecks> solves for the marginal incremental effects of 
% a vector of checks for all household types, and stores the results to file. 
% This operation is fully parallelizable. 
%% 
% Given the solution, <https://fanwangecon.github.io/PrjOptiSNW/PrjOptiSNW/doc/splannerjaeemk/htmlpdfm/snwx_evuvw19_jaeemk_mky.html 
% snwx_evuvw19_jaeemk_mky> shows key overall distributional statistics, and distributional 
% statistics by kids, marital and income bins.
%% Dynamic Programming Timing
% Overall time requirements for solving the checks problem on a standard ($1000) 
% dollar desktop with 4 cores:
%% 
% * 30 minutes to 1 hour: solving the dynamic programming problem 3 times for 
% covid-less world, for covid-world with unemployement shock and without.  
% * 3 hours: derive the distributions induced by policy functions and shock 
% processes. 
% * 650 seconds: the time it takes to compute the marginal effects of one check. 
% This step is fully scalable. With a cloud computer with larger memory and cores, 
% the problem over all checks could be solved fully parallelly. 
%% 
% Due to the large state-space, especially the large shock-grid, the memory 
% requirement for storing the various multi-dimensional matrixes is high. Solving 
% the problem requires 20GB of memory.
% 
% On a workstation with 12 cores with 190 GB of memory (12 workers same time), 
% the computer is able to fully solve the problem from start to finish for 244 
% check increments in less than 24 hours. On a computer with 4 to 6 cores and 
% 36 GB of memory, the computer is able to fully solve the problem from start 
% to finish for 244 check increments in about 48 hours.
