    Expected Value from 2019 Given Age, Kids, Income and Marriage.
    Each 2019 income group consists of individuals with varying productivity shocks, savings, and from lower and higher education groups.

    Expected Value from 2019/2020 (Trump/Biden Checks) Given Age, Kids, Income and Marriage for All Checks.
    This is the gateway function that solves policy functions, derive distributions, computes value in 2020 with and without unemployment shocks with varying check levels, derives 2019 planner expected values given household optimization and shocks, and finds the mass of individuals in different income/age/marital-status bins, and saves the simulated value of check results for the planner.

    Expected Value from 2007 Given Age, Kids, Income and Marriage for All Checks.
    This is the gateway function that solves policy functions. The function derives distributions, computes value in 2008 with varying check levels, given unemployment expectation in 2009. It finds the 2007 planner expected values given household optimization and shocks, and finds the mass of individuals in different income/age/marital-status bins, and saves the simulated value of check results for the planner.
