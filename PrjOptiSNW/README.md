This is a matlab folder that is responsible for solving the value to the planner given different levels of COVID Checks.

The folder contains code for the matlab toolbox that:

1. Solves household dynamic programming problems that incorporates
    - permanent exogenous: marriage (0 or 1), education (0 or 1), and age
    - stochastic exogenous: productivity shocks, child shock (0 to 5), survival probability
    - dynamically endogenous: savings
    - progressive taxation
    - social security
2. Simulate life-cycle distributions given exogenous initial distributions
3. Balances government budgets
4. Solves for planner value over household types given COVID shocks
